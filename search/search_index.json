It then defines the MyDumper class, which is a subclass of yaml.Dumper. This class overrides the increase_indent method to prevent the indentless parameter from being set to True, which would otherwise cause the generated YAML to be \"compact\" in format. Copy code def generate_mkdocs_settings(folder): pages = [] for path, subdirs, files in os.walk(folder): page_list = [] for name in files: page_list.append(path[7:]+'/'+name) pages.append({path: page_list}) return { 'site_name': 'My MkDocs Site', 'site_url': 'https://daangeijs.github.io/chatgpt-autodocs/', 'theme': 'readthedocs', 'nav': pages } This code defines the generate_mkdocs_settings function. This function takes a folder parameter and uses it to create a list of pages for the website. The function does this by using the os.walk function to traverse the directory tree under the given folder. For each file in the tree, the function creates a dictionary that maps the file path to the file name. This dictionary is then added to a list of pages. The function then returns a dictionary of settings for the website, including the list of pages, the site name, URL, and theme. Copy code mkdocs_settings = generate_mkdocs_settings('docs') a = yaml.dump(mkdocs_settings, Dumper=MyDumper, default_flow_style=False) with open('mkdocs.yml', 'w') as f: f.write(a) This code calls the generate_mkdocs_settings function with the 'docs' folder as the argument. The resulting dictionary of settings is then passed to the yaml.dump function, along with the MyDumper class and the default_flow_style parameter set to False. This causes the YAML output to be formatted in a more readable way. The generated YAML is then written to a file called mkdocs.yml using a with statement and a file handle.","title":"Test"}]}
