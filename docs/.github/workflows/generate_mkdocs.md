This code is generating a mkdocs.yml file for a MkDocs site. It does so by:

1. Importing the `os` and `yaml` modules.

2. Defining a function `generate_mkdocs_settings()` that takes a `folder` as an argument and generates a dictionary of MkDocs site settings based on the files in the specified `folder`. This function walks through the `folder` and its subdirectories, and creates a list of pages to be included in the site's navigation menu.

3. The `generate_mkdocs_settings()` function is called with the `'docs'` folder as an argument, and the resulting dictionary of settings is stored in the `mkdocs_settings` variable.

4. The `yaml.dump()` function is called on the `mkdocs_settings` dictionary, and the resulting YAML string is stored in the `a` variable.

5. The YAML string is written to a file named `mkdocs.yml`.

Summary:
- Generates a mkdocs.yml file for a MkDocs site
- Uses the `os` and `yaml` modules
- Walks through a specified `folder` and creates a list of pages for the site's navigation menu
- Writes the resulting YAML string to a file named `mkdocs.yml`.
